# Game Development Resources
The following repository contains information and code from various online tutorials as well as images to be used in different game development environments.

The pygame code is based from the magazine: Make Games with Python
The code for the magazine can be located at: https://github.com/seanmtracey/Games-with-Pygame

All sprites not provided by the aforementioned repo have been created either using GIMP or the online sprite editor Piskel: https://www.piskelapp.com

Any other scripts and files that don't fall under the afforementioned resources were developed by me(and those files will also say so) and are to be used by anyone that finds this useful.
